// Hey there!
//
// Welcome to the code! This project involved a lot
// of prototyping. There's a bunch of
// cruft left over from that. Other than that
// the big thing to know is that this I'm
// using bitty for this `https://bitty.alanwsmith.com`.
// It's the first real thing I've built with it.
// Helped me refine a bunch. I really like
// the way it's working.
